<h1 align="center">Tiles is a simple CRUD todo application.</h1>

This app is not for the super-highly organized folks. This is for the scatter brained, just get the idea of out my head individual. So go ahead, brain dump!

The frontend of the application consists of a very simple form and list. By communicating with the API, the user can _Create_, _Read_, _Update_, and _Delete_ todo tiles.

In this project my focus was mainly on the backend and building an application through the lens of the backend. Instead of storing everything in local storage Tiles has a built-in API that communicates with a MongoDB cloud database and persists data to the cloud.

The app is being deployed on Netlify and utilizes _serverless functions_ to build out the "serverless" backend.
